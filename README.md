You can find many of my Android books, articles, and video courses here: https://www.kodeco.com/u/abunur



I also teach a Mobile Design & Development college course at [Howard Community College](https://www.howardcc.edu). 



I enjoy diving deep into business problems and finding solutions that truly benefit my clients, mentoring others and constantly educating myself.



Here's what some of my clients have had to say about me:



> "Fuad and his team at Anaara took our mobile applications a huge step forward. They revived our Android app, rewrote our iOS app from the ground up, creating a truly responsive and intuitive experience for our users. Fuad’s attention to detail, his professional conduct, and commitment to quality helped us to create a better product. Fuad and his team are very passionate about mobile and always keep themselves abreast of the latest platform developments. It was a pleasure to work with them."



-Ramanarayanan Balasubramanian, Product Manager (Big Data and Mobile) at Envolve PeopleCare



> "Our company provides critical solutions for large telecom companies worldwide. We found an ideal partnership in Fuad and his team at Anaara. They helped us to create customized solutions for our clients, such as a mobile app that would allow executives to keep track of network health from anywhere across the globe. Their development prowess was second to none as was their expertise in user experience, information design and data visualization. Anaara supported us in bringing cutting edge business solutions to our clients every time. It has truly been a pleasure to work with the folks at Anaara."



-Rajneesh Malik, VP of RAN at AMDOCS





> “Fuad always seemed to know exactly what I needed to get to the next level. He would challenge and push me; however, he would never overwhelm me. He had a keen sense of what I was ready for every step of the way…Fuad was a phenomenal mentor, and I would highly recommend him for others.” -Brett Padgett, Director, Citigroup (Public Finance)



> “Fuad is very sharp technically and has great ideas on how to improve the processes, frameworks and technology setup for the App and the team” 

-Pranav Kariwala, Director of IT, First Data Corporation



> “Fuad is a pleasure to work with. He demonstrates a deep understanding of mobile UX and keeps up-to-date on the latest in mobile development, bringing optimal solutions for our mobile strategy to market."

-Ginny Hong, UX Designer, Centene Corporation



> "I just wanted to say thank you to everyone on your team for creating such a wonderful place to learn. Two years ago I decided that I needed to push my career forward and that my technical knowledge wasn't where I wanted it to be. Your easy to understand yet in depth explanation of technologies really evolved my own self development and I can't say thank you enough. I went from not being able to write a single program without a google search to securing a software engineering job at Apple! Once again, thank you so much and I wish the best for all of your team's future endeavors!"
